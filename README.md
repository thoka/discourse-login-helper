This discourse plugin is an attempt to simplify the login process for novice, mass subscribed users.

Links to the forum (initially only links in the footer) are enriched with the user's e-mail address. 

When the user follows a link to the usually restricted page, he is redirected to a pre-filled user registration form.

After entering a password, users will be redirected to the restricted page.

Next steps:

- [ ] implement redirection to the page also for login via mail
- [ ] enrich all links in notifications to discourse with user information
