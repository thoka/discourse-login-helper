This discourse plugin is an attempt to simplify the login process for novice, mass subscribed users.

Links to the forum are enriched with the user's e-mail address. 

When a not loged-in user follows a link (A) to a restricted page a login-mail is sent without need for further interaction.

After using the there provided login-link the user will be redirected to A.

## Changelog

0.4 store destination_url's in email-tokens and redirect there during login procedure
0.3 enrich all links in notifications to discourse with user information
